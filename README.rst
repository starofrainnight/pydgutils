pydgutils (PYthon DownGrade UTILS)
----------------------------------------

This library use for compatilbe purpose.

It provided a simple method to preprocess sources to python2 syntax (if
using python2) and do nothing while using python3.

So that you could write your project in python3 syntax and install on python2
without any changes, all jobs are done by 3to2 module which we depends on.
